		</div>
		<div class="text-section">
			<p>Real estate has provided generations of investors with wealth. However, it has
			historically been reserved for those with specialized knowledge, the right
			connections and access to great amounts of capital. This has kept investing in
			commercial real estate out of reach for most - until a few years ago.</p>
			<p>While working in the multiple sectors, our CEO Sunny Abbasi identified three key
			insights that separated the clients who invested in real estate from the rest.</p>
			<p>List Capital Advisors was founded with over 250 years of combined real estate
			transactional and investment experience. LCA is a brokerage firm which Sells,
			Leases, and Auctions off Commercial and Residential Properties Nationwide. In
			addition to being a Brokerage Firm, LCA is also a Private Equity/Funding Firm that
			focuses on Acquiring and Leasing NNN Investment Real Estate with Asset
			Management through the entire United States. We offer our clients and investors
			an opportunity to access an auction and an opportunity to take on equity
			partnership in researched, feasible, and high return projects. </p>
